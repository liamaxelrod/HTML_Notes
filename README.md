###### Purpose.

Was to refresh my memory and make it easier to recall things on HTML when I need to. Either by looking at the website or just simply because I took notes, what reinforces knowledge.

Also, I do have plans To refresh my knowledge on other coding languages and learn new ones. While doing this I plan on connecting all these languages with websites to create collective. The notes I take on the different coding languages and. I plan on creating different websites for each coding language and Connecting the different websites.
